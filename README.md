Exercise 0 - Dodge the creeps


All assets including art and music were borrowed from Godot's "Your first 2D game" tutorial. I do not own any art or music assets included in the game. Godot's tutorial can be found here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html


Project Report:
I successfully completed the tutorial and implemented version control management. The tutorial does not contain the licenses for the supplied art and music, so I did my best to credit what I could with licenses
